## Getting Started

```bash
pnpm install    
pnpm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

It uses Clerk for authentication and Convex for database storage. And the Vercel platform for deployment.

The Vercel AI SDK is used to power the AI models.
